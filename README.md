# MITM Server

This MITM server has been superseded by the new data collection plugin which is easier to use and requires
less additional setup https://github.com/PocketRelay/PocketRelayDataCollectPlugin. 

This is formerly the Man-In-The-Middle server which was apart of the Pocket Relay server
but has since been moved here seperating it from the Pocket Relay server as its unlikely
that this functionality will be used by anyone other than those developing the server. This will also reduce the binary size and clutter that its added to the main server.
